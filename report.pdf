Perfect! Let’s make the **entire report content in README.md format** so you can directly put it in GitHub or even open it in a Markdown viewer as a “report.” I’ll also make it **clean, structured, and readable**.

## 1. Introduction
This project develops a **Weather Data Storage System** to store and retrieve temperature records based on **city** and **year**.  
The system uses **Abstract Data Types (ADT)** and **2D arrays** for structured storage.  
It also supports **sparse datasets**, allowing memory-efficient storage when some records are missing.

---

## 2. Weather Record ADT
**Attributes:**
- **Date** → String (format: dd/mm/yyyy), e.g., "01/06/2025"  
- **City** → String, e.g., "Gurgaon"  
- **Temperature** → Float/Double, e.g., 34°C  

**Methods:**
- `insert(record)` → Adds a weather record.  
- `delete(city, date)` → Removes a record.  
- `retrieve(city, year)` → Returns the temperature for the city in that year.  
- `traverse()` → Iterates through all stored records.  

The ADT ensures **modular design** and **data integrity**.

---

## 3. Memory Representation Strategy

### Row-Major Order
- Rows → Years (2025, 2026)  
- Columns → Cities (Gurgaon)  
- Traversal accesses all cities for a year before moving to the next.

**Example:**  
```

\[ (2025, 'Gurgaon') ]
\[ (2026, 'Gurgaon') ]

```

### Column-Major Order
- Columns → Cities  
- Rows → Years  
- Traversal accesses all years for a city before moving to the next.

---

## 4. Handling Sparse Data
- **Dense Matrix with Sentinel Values:** Missing entries represented as `None`.  
- **Sparse Dictionary Representation:** Stores only filled records `(year, city): temperature`.

**Example Sparse Dictionary:**
```

{ (2025, 'Gurgaon'): 34,
(2026, 'Gurgaon'): 31 }

````

This approach ensures **memory efficiency** for incomplete datasets.

---

## 5. Time and Space Complexity

| Operation     | Dense (2D Array) | Sparse (Dictionary) |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Insert        | O(1)            | O(1)              |
| Delete        | O(1)            | O(1)              |
| Retrieve      | O(1)            | O(1)              |
| Row Traversal | O(n × m)        | O(k)              |
| Column Traversal | O(n × m)     | O(k)              |

- `n` = number of years (2)  
- `m` = number of cities (1)  
- `k` = number of filled records  

**Space Complexity:**  
- Dense → O(n × m)  
- Sparse → O(k)

---

## 6. Sample Execution

```python
from weather_ds import WeatherRecord, DataStorage

years = [2025, 2026]
cities = ["Gurgaon"]
ds = DataStorage(years, cities, sentinel=None)

r1 = WeatherRecord("01/06/2025", "Gurgaon", 34)
r2 = WeatherRecord("15/07/2026", "Gurgaon", 31)

ds.insert(r1)
ds.insert(r2)

print(ds.retrieve("Gurgaon", 2025))
print(ds.row_major_access())
print(ds.handle_sparse_data())
````

**Output:**

```
34
[(2025, 'Gurgaon', 34), (2026, 'Gurgaon', 31)]
{'total': 2, 'filled': 2, 'missing': 0}
```

---

## 7. Conclusion

The Weather Data Storage System demonstrates:

* Efficient storage and retrieval of weather records using **ADT and 2D arrays**.
* Both **row-major and column-major traversal** strategies.
* **Sparse data handling** for memory-efficient storage.
* Predictable **time and space complexity** for operations.

This system meets all the **assignment objectives** and provides a practical example of structured data management.

If you want, I can **also combine this README with the “Usage + Demo + Code” section** so your GitHub repo has a single **all-in-one report + demo README** that looks professional and opens without issues.  

Do you want me to do that?
